# Painting Program

You will use your knowledge about keyboard and mouse to create a simple painting program.

Base Requirements:

- Clicking the mouse should draw
- You should be able to change the color somehow
- You should be able to change the brush thickness somehow
- You should be able to clear the drawing area
- Make this your own (i.e. put in your own ideas)

Extensibility:

- Add another tool (lines, circles, whatever you want!)
- Add more elaborate ways of interacting (different mouse buttons, or the keyboard)
- Some interesting way to change colors automatically (by speed or gradients or whatever you can think of!)

Work in this directory (`Sketch_04_PaintingProgram`) and don't forget committing and pushing the result! This one is **due 2023-11-22 18:30**.
